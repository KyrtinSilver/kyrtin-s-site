Today I realized something that most people desperately need for the AI domain, an abridged “Tech-Watcher’s Guide to the Species Inhabiting the AGI Archipelago”. Like Darwin before me, I’ve spent considerable time studying the these loosely connected islands of activity and thought, developing an evolving understanding of their respective residents.

**Toy Theoristia**

First, we have the “Toy Theoristia”, a creature you may often find foraging for academic funding, with many theories, stacked one on top of another, and often paired with some toy demonstrations. They are mostly harmless, but can become very noisy if you stray into their territory. Likewise, their only “Skin in the Game” is purely theoretical.

**Main-character Soloista**

Next, we observe the “Main-character Soloista”, a species which lives a largely nomadic and isolated life, loudly evangelizing themselves by proclaiming that they alone solved some major problem, before promptly being driven out of an area by the other native species. This correlates with Autism + poor social development in particular.

**Trend Glider**

The “Trend Glider” is one of the most prolific species in the spring and summer months, feverishly active little creatures with their bright eyes and bushy tails, known for their foraging and rapid procreation. They are also a popular food source for the two native predators noted below.

**Disinformation Brokeris**

Take special care to avoid the “Disinformation Brokeris”, a particularly poisonous species, known to carry numerous pathogens, which frequently takes up residency adjacent to any food source that its prey favors. They are known to lure in their prey by imitating the mating calls of other species.

**Tech-Broligarchus**

Another dangerous species is a type of poisonous urchin, the “Tech-Broligarchus”, known to breed in small fresh water ponds, luring a variety of other species with sweet-smelling intoxicants. The intoxicants eventually overwhelm many of these prey, causing them to fall unconscious into the water, becoming the food source of these urchins.

**Minimalist Adapticus**

One particularly novel creature is the lethargic “Minimalist Adapticus”, with a digestive system that allows it to turn even the Archipelago’s most toxic food stuffs into the small amounts of nutritious ROI that their slow metabolisms require. They make their homes in many of the oldest trees on these islands, sheltering them from seasonal liability storms.

**Innovator Collectivae**

Lastly, we have the endangered species of the “Innovator Collectivae”, a highly social and collective organism known to engineer amazing and intricate structures, if you can find them. They tend to avoid sunlight, noisy areas, and are repelled by the poisons of Brokeris and Broligarchus, leaving them with limited resources to draw upon in this Archipelago. Among all of the species found therein, only this one actually contributes to the local ecology.

I invite everyone to add their own sightings of these curious species, as well as those not included in this abridged edition, though I will warn strongly against declaring any premature sightings of the Innovator Collectivae.
