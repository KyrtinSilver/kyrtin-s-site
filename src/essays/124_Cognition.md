Following feedback, I've added 3 more sections and 6 more visual aids to the recent educational paper addressing complexity, cognitive bias, and emotional motivation, as they relate to instantiation in software and non-trivial definitions of "AGI" [ResearchGate](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.11390.56641).

The added sections address comparing data quality between architectures and over time, as well as differences in the dynamics of uncertainty, and both the similarities and differences between software instantiation in a graph database versus hardware instantiation in a human brain.

With it up to 41 pages and nearly 15,000 words in length I'll have loads of fun locating a place to properly publish it, as most conferences try to charge you by the page for anything beyond 15. As the primary purpose of this paper is education, it may be rolled into a complete book on the architecture that my colleague has been interested in publishing for the past couple of years, but that we never got around to finalizing.

Plenty of big names have thrown their hats into the ring in the past year, but what they all seem to have in common is that upon closer inspection they're utterly clueless and have nothing to show for their efforts except theories that could have been debunked in previous years. The question ahead of us is if billions will continue to be burned on internet-scale garbage generators, flooding 2024 during the big election season, and leading to consequences that are both entirely predictable and critically severe.
