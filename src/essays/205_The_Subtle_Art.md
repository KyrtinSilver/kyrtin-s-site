In revisiting another very good and well-named book in the past few days, "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck", I was reminded of the eloquent ways in which the author verbalizes the lessons that I had internalized as I chose to embody them, but rarely spoke of over the years, save to close friends and colleagues. The beginning would be to recognize the finite nature of every human’s most precious resource, more precious even than time itself, the "F\*cks they have to give". 

Make no mistake, your "F\*cks to give" and the subsequent division of your attention are budgets, consuming not just your finite time, but also your cognition and motivation, both of which serve as vital currencies upon which the economy of your mind functions. Much like the global economy, there are bad actors who’ll attempt to steal your "F\*cks" through the so-called "attention economy". 

When this occurs, people are often left with a sense of aimlessness, helplessness, and apathy, imprisoning themselves within a maze of misdirection from dark patterns, cheap highs, and novel distractions. Though that maze has no locks, to the emotional (unconscious) self it also often appears to have no exits.

I first chose to read the book only after two unrelated friends and colleagues independently sent me a photo of it and said that seeing it made them think of me. Having that happen once was interesting, but the second occurrence was sufficiently unlikely that it drew my attention. I found that it offered another convergent path to much of what experience had taught me over the years. In a way, it extends and modernizes some concepts of Stoicism, something else friends and colleagues saw in my way of thinking.

For example, I can clearly separate the things that I do and do not "give a F\*ck about". I do give a F\*ck about:

- The subject matter of papers I write. Nothing requires me to write academic and research papers, but I donate those F\*cks because the subjects are that important.

- Offering a means by which humanity can survive the coming years, through the work of my team.

- The one or more competent investors on the planet, should they ever be found, provided that they do exist.

In contrast, I give no F\*cks about:

- How those papers are received and which journals publish them.
- Whether humanity chooses to survive or not.
- Every "investor" who proved less than competent.

Financial competence means keeping budgets, and so too does emotional competence, both of which are skills that anyone may learn. Budget your F\*cks wisely, and more often than not you can avoid finding yourself in emotional debt. Invest in yourself by giving a F\*ck about the F\*cks that you give.
