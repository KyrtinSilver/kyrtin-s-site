The greatest opportunity for virtually any industry with >$1 billion in annual revenue is the implementation and assistance of scalable human-like intelligence in software. For most industries, that opportunity exceeds all others by one or more orders of magnitude (10x+).

When someone calling themselves an "investor" tells me that what I'm describing is outside of their domain, I do my best not to look at them like they're drooling all over themselves. "Domains" are by their very definition sufficiently broad that none of them that I've ever encountered are truly outside of the scope of such technology. Part of the reason for that is that scalable human-like intelligence in software can be applied to virtually any problem that human intelligence can, and many that it cannot. It isn't contained to one domain or even a few, but rather it is broader than the sum of all human domains combined.

On top of this fundamental versatility, such technology is also dynamically adaptive, able to independently explore and expand into new domains as opportunities emerge. That means that opportunities can be utilized before other companies even realize that they exist, and those opportunities can in turn feed into deeper advantages that others couldn't even recognize without first taking the previous steps.

Keep in mind, that LLMs, RL, and other similarly trivial "AI" technology isn't remotely human-like, and most of it has all of the scalability of a brick. Those technologies are still mostly just toys, easily broken, and not capable of providing the faintest shred of added value I'm describing.

Similarly, virtually every government has even more reason to invest in viable technology, since they span both a larger scale and broader scope of different domains, suffering from hyper-complexity and subsequently deteriorating performance. The longer they wait to take that step, the less say they have in the development of such technologies.

In many cases, it would be trivial for a government to make the wise choice. For example, $300 bn in frozen funds from the Russian Oligarchy were seized and assigned to the purpose of rebuilding post-war Ukraine, but the only way that $300 bn would cover that cost, to begin with, is by massively improving the efficacy and efficiency of methods and technology applied to the task. The only realistic way to make that happen is by investing in the one technology capable of delivering those improvements, which would create cost-savings exceeding the investment by at least two orders of magnitude, plus an equal or greater increase in the value of the investment itself over time.

It only takes 1 investor, private, corporate, or government, to change the world.
