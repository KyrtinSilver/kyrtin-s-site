It seems to me that there should be a music platform/market for split usage, where high-fidelity synthesized vocals are paired with music on-demand, rather than as a fixed bundle, simply splitting rights to music between two parties based on demand, and on the fly.

If presented with the opportunity to hear their favorite musicians sing some of the other songs that a person likes, most people would likely leap at the opportunity. Why settle for only hearing someone sing the songs that they originally made when you can hear them sing anything?

A few more after-hours experiments later (with models others have published) I can say that @David Draiman sings Moana and Alladin very well (and most other Disney songs I've tried), and @Steve Harwell does an excellent Gangnam Style.

How would people discover these things otherwise? Not many could, since they can't really be shared at present. They could potentially not only be shared, but voted up in popularity, and creativity could be encouraged for those who come up with the most successful combinations of music and vocals.

The opportunity that musicians and the music industry have been searching for may be found in the creation of such a platform, I'd certainly listen to more diverse music given the opportunity to hear any artist sing any song.

To consider this another way, imagine you were hanging out with your favorite musicians for karaoke, and you had the chance to persuade them to give a particular song of your choice a shot. Sounds fun right? Now multiply that by all available time, where the same opportunity is always available.

Cover artists are popular specifically because of this dynamic, but their offerings are both slow on delivery and very sparse. This can change, and a new dimension will be added to music, offering new opportunities for creative individuals.

This is one of the potentially positive things that 2024 could make possible, though I'd be curious to hear the thoughts of musicians on such uses of new technology.
