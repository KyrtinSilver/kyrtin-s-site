The Tech industry standard is to hide as much information as possible, presenting only the finest distilled snake oil on silver platters behind closed doors to the world's most gullible "investors". After seeing this process repeat like clockwork for the past year and a half, and leaks like the sad 7-page Mistral "strategic memo" that produced investments over $110m, I see every reason for our team to move in the opposite direction, toward transparency.

"AI Startups" with precisely or virtually zero innovation, like OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, and Inflection, hide everything that they can because they have "no moat" as one Google engineer famously put it. They are all slight and trivial variations on a grossly overhyped technology.

New bells and whistles are routinely added (like RAG) to keep people distracted from the fundamental flaws that LLMs and RL are architecturally incapable of ever overcoming. That distraction and artificial overcomplication in turn helps to fuel FOMO and other flaws in human judgment, socially engineering "investors" and "clients" into abandoning any wisdom they might otherwise possess.

Many governments, corporations, and domains are demanding capacities that LLMs and RL can never deliver, including (non-trivial) understanding, reasoning, transparency, explainability, alignment, ethics, and cybersecurity to name a few. Those capacities will never be delivered at all if a competent and/or ethical investor isn't located, as they seem to be very rare, if they exist at all.

To that end, I'm sharing a current version of our Pitch Deck. We've spent the past 4+ years at the cutting edge because we have an actual moat, having built the necessary technology from scratch, rather than relying on neural networks or even older expert systems.

Our previous research system may have operated in slow motion, making it unsuitable for demos today, but the funding we're working to secure will allow us to complete the software infrastructure work that gives us human-like, human-level, and human-aligned systems (demonstrated, 7th gen) that operate in real-time, with full scalability and modularity (8th gen, post-infrastructure).

To investors:

- If you want shiny objects to play with or ask us to beat companies who can't compete with us on benchmarks that aren't relevant, in real-time (requiring the software infrastructure we're raising funds for in the first place) then I will probably tell you to go $%&\* yourself, and your future will look very grim thereafter.

- If you want to make a positive impact on the world, don't avoid innovation like the plague, want to have a significant say in humanity's future, and/or want to make a considerable ROI, we'll make time to meet with you.

*This is transparency.*
