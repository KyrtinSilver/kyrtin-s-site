All apps, websites, and popups therein need a button for strong negative feedback. Without that, the only negative feedback is the tiny fraction to pass through many layers and filters of survivorship bias, painting a rosy picture, whereas reality instead reveals an unflushed toilet.

To drive the strongly negative nature of this hypothetical feedback button home, I'll refer to it as the "FyV" button, standing for ("F%^& you Vermin"). If such a button wasn't obscured by dark patterns, such as highlighting other buttons and misdirecting attention away from it, then I suspect it could quickly become the most popular button for many locations on the internet and within apps.

You have no idea how much people hate the trash you produce until you give them a viable means of expressing it. Many places explicitly choose not to allow negative feedback at all, such as LinkedIn, where all emoji-based "reactions" are purely positive, which intentionally warps the platform into an unreality of misinformation and echo chambers. Reddit, YouTube, and many other platforms use positive and negative voting systems, but you can also bet that every time they do something sleezy there isn't a strong negative feedback button for it.
