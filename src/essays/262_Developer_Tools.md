If you want more productive software development, build tools that aren't complete $hit. GitHub and VS are spectacularly crap, to the point where you can spend more time debugging their $hit systems than you do debugging the actual code you're working on. I can literally get more done by manually download a zip file from GitHub and editing it in Notepad.

I remember a statistic from some years back that ~98% of the code in VS is never used, a prime example of the bloated mess of spaghetti code they run on, which GitHub evidently takes after. As they're both owned by the biggest Sadists in UX/UI, Microsoft, this isn't terribly surprising.

This problem is only getting worse over time, as "Generative" garbage compounds it, every "integration" adds new failures, and 100% of the code I've come across on Stack Overflow failed to aid in debugging the platforms. This is a likely byproduct of generative AI slop answers rising to the top of results, as well as many bad "fixes" on the platforms themselves.
