If I go silent then it is usually a sign that things are happening. Our team is one of 8 finalists in a “Startup Showdown” taking place at an AI Conference in SF on September 10th, and the ARC-AGI Challenge will be run with one of our mid-assembly systems soon.

I had previously estimated the probability of being selected as a finalist for such a conference competition as very low, 5%, denoting the default margin of error. It may be a fluke, a true 5% probability event, or it may be that the AI industry is finally starting to look beyond trash technology like LLMs and the various things built on top of them. I can’t even guess the revised probability yet, pending further evidence.
 
Whether or not the competition gives us a gold star, or whatever one is supposed to “win” at such an event, things are moving in the right direction, and given the right direction then acceleration becomes a “when” rather than an “if”.

The score validation process for ARC-AGI is complicated for anything that can’t simply be uploaded to Kaggle like a proprietary and patent-pending cognitive architecture developed over the past 11 years from scratch, but I’d be rather surprised if they proved unwilling to validate a new high score.

Our CEO will present the company on stage for the 10th: [https://aiconference.com/](https://aiconference.com/)

I’ll be grading the competence of the VC panel remotely from Japan.
