As a perspective-taking exercise this morning I decided to build an investor decision tree. Regardless of which excuses are used at any given point, the decision structure can be boiled down to a handful of bottlenecks and motivating factors.

For example, cognitive biases favoring an "in-group" of someone's personal network, or ex-employees of one or more tech firms, are excuses, rather than decisions. Excuses are like the confabulations (sometimes anthropomorphically called "hallucinations") of LLMs, in that they aren't bounded by reality, and are thus infinite in variety.

As any teacher is familiar with, you can only teach someone who wants to learn. There are infinite excuses for one who doesn't want to learn, making the motivation to learn critical.
