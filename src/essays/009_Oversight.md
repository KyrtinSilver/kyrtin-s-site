If you've ever wondered what over $10 billion getting flushed down the toilet sounds like, [the FTC's leaked letter to OpenAI makes it crystal clear](https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/67a7081c-c770-4f05-a39e-9d02117e50e8.pdf).


The letter requires them to disclose all of the prompt injections that worked against their systems, all of the users impacted by those injections, how they were detected, all of the misinformation OpenAI's systems have generated, and various other data that offers OpenAI the choice to either be honest and accept varying degrees of criminal liability or to lie to the US government in an attempt to stall for time.

Of course, this isn't specific to OpenAI at all. The other tech giants who deployed the same completely derivative technology are in the same boat, which now has a gaping hole in it, way up S%^& Creek without a paddle.

Did anyone actually believe they were going to get away with deploying vulnerable-by-design misinformation generators across the planet indefinitely?

Once the shiny object loses novelty then people are bound to question what impact it actually has.
