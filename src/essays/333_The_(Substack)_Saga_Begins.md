People have mentioned that LinkedIn makes it difficult to see what someone is posting, so with some help from a good friend and colleague [I’ve set up a Substack](https://kyrtin.substack.com/) for the purpose of cross-posting everything, including exporting over 300 previous LinkedIn posts there.

It has become rather comical seeing “Top Voice” influencers with 100-200K followers who’re getting less traction on their own posts than my median or average, presumably as the AI slop washes away other content from newsfeeds, optimizing to the selection algorithm. I don’t actually want to become an influencer, but I don’t want people to struggle needlessly against LinkedIn’s AI slop in search of what I share either.

What I share is 90% demonstrated, 5% prediction, 4% questions, and ~1% personal preference or opinion (where so noted), with no quotas to meet or anyone to appease. If something is worth my time to write about it, I will max out the character limit doing so. If it is not, then you probably won’t hear about it from me.

I’m not a consultant, I’ll never be for hire or sale, I don’t have a newsletter or books to sell, and as multiple colleagues independently reported before I ever read the book, when they saw “The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F^&*” they’d immediately think of me, and tell me as much. I’m also technically not an “AI skeptic”, having worked with more advanced technology. I work with groups of people known for their candor, people who are usually either autistic 10x engineers or culturally Dutch. This dynamic makes our work far easier, and those who are less than candid far more obvious by contrast.

I welcome any feedback on the new Substack, and my good friend gets credit for designing the stylized logo and theme, shy though he remains for me to mention his name. I will continue trying to reply to as many people as my available time allows, which as I work about 7 days per week tends to cover a lot of ground, but perhaps still not enough if more posts go truly viral.

The goal of most of these posts is to educate, to warn, and/or to get people thinking about new ways to solve the problems that we face. Many are rooted in the various research papers that I constantly read, some others in news circulating through AI Discord servers, and some are realized through more direct experience. There is no central narrative that I’m driving in them, just value to be shared as it becomes visible.

To anyone interested in having a virtual coffee to discuss technology, I have set up a new scheduling system for that purpose, but I will give you the homework to read no less than these 3 papers before meeting with me:

i. [The Complex Chaos of Cognitive Biases and Emotional Observers](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.11390.56641)

ii. [The Case for Human-like Scalable Intelligence in the Medical Field](http://dx.doi.org/10.47852/bonviewJDSIS52023415)

iii. [Solving the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) AI Benchmark with ICOM](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.32495.34727)

Let this be the most that I talk about myself for the next year, as I personally can’t stand doing so for long. I hope everyone learns something, particularly if it is “how better to learn”.

To anyone with a podcast, I will give you the same homework, plus [my last podcast appearance with Lasse Rindom](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-11-kyrtin-atreides-generative-ai-and/id1718531331?i=1000644636056), on "The Only Constant."
