Given the feverish pace with which people have latched onto OponziAI's current events, I'll take a rare departure from my schedule to share these events summarized in meme form.

Two of the ringleaders of their fraudulent activities are being pushed out, Sam and Greg, after they managed to surpass Bernie Madoff's record of $54 bn in fraud in recent weeks.

This doesn't make the people taking more power there any less guilty, nor does it rationally imply any change in direction. They still have the inertia of a full year's worth of fraud, and even if Microsoft M&A were to acquire them quickly and eat the pile of #$^& in full public view to the tune of billions more in a third doubling down on a bad investment, they'd still be unable to avoid the trainwreck.

Unless they want to have their own "change in leadership" they're unlikely to overcome that inertia with a hard pivot in any new direction.

The justification for pushing those two ringleaders out is also fundamentally misaligned with Microsoft, as Microsoft is even further misaligned with their claimed "company values" than Ponzi Schemers, if only because Microsoft is more brazen.

Keep in mind that Altman is a diversified fraud, with strong ties to many other frauds. His cryptocurrency and "fusion" investments have both been robustly accused of fraud, at least one of which Microsoft was also idiotic enough to bite into. He also has close ties to the pair of frauds that laundered $500m from Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) only months before SBF was sent to prison. Those ties date back to a $30m deal between roommates, to give you an idea of just how close these frauds are with one another.

While it is still conjecture as to whether Microsoft will seek a majority or full acquisition of OponziAI, what we can be fairly certain of is that if they do Amazon will be very tempted to swallow the even more obvious frauds who laundered money from SBF's Ponzi scheme.

These two "competing" groups of frauds (former roommates) have been playing both sides against the other, to the tune of billions of dollars. Neither side is getting "AGI", or anything remotely close to it, as neither company has done a shred of work on that.

In the parlance of parts of the US, "Here's your sign".
