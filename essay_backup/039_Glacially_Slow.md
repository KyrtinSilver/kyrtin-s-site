Writing research papers for peer review is another useful method for both organizing information and perspective-taking. Information is systematically organized into labeled sections, with citations added for points being made and prior work that a paper builds on, with sections like discussion and future research challenging the writer to add value in context. A good 12-page paper may take a few days to write, but the process can offer insights unlikely to otherwise occur in similar periods of time.

I just received confirmation for my next paper to be published in peer review via Springer for a Special issue of Cognitive Systems Research. It is on the topic of market-driven AI Indoctrination and Cognitive Bias at Scale, with a pre-print available [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369691463_Automated_Bias_and_Indoctrination_at_Scale_Is_All_You_Need).

Peer review remains glacially slow and subject to high levels of both bias and 'noise' in the process, but those pain points bring to mind a quote about Democracy:

> "Many forms of Government have been tried, and will be tried in this world of sin and woe. No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed it has been said that democracy is the worst form of Government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time...."
